# Reasons to share what you've learned

Like myself, a lot of engineers are introverted. It indicates that they are reflective individuals who work, entertain, and learn in silence. This kind of thinking uses the exchange of social capital to keep people stuck in their comfort zones.

Engineers should sell themselves similarly to how brands do. If you're skilled at solving problems and have knowledge of technology (Java,.NET, or anything else), you should let the market know that you're the person they should hire when they need a technological expert.

Every brand markets, therefore you ought to too. The earlier, the better. This is call social capital. It's the money you accrue over time in the form of influence, reciprocity, and trust.

# Invest in Social Capital

> Social capital is "the networks of relationships among people who live and work in a particular society, enabling that society to function effectively"  
From wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_capital  

 Your social capital can provide substantial returns, much like money investments, and help you achieve both personal and professional success.
