# The pain.
During my working hours, I perform a lot of research and wish to bookmark and share it with my network and build my personal brand. The internal corporate chat does not operate because it is intended for internal use and provides no benefit to my former coworker. Using social media is a distraction during work hours. What I can do is take notes and share them later. This is time-consuming and forgettable.

# Branding in the world of remote employment
Today's remote worker has new challenges when it comes to developing a brand. Individuals work remotely while seated in their "own offices," exchanging knowledge outside of coffee shops with other people. With so many distractions from advertisers on the internet these days, social media providers have made learning and sharing less free.

# The internet was once enjoyable.
People have created their own websites on the internet to share their interests, knowledge, and fresh experiences in a distraction-free environment.

Kuratus was created to restore this enjoyment by providing simplicity and a distraction-free environment.  
> Anyone can curate their own learning, share it, and build a network of like-minded individuals.

Your brand will get stronger as you gain more knowledge and experience.

# Fun fact
The history of curate as:  

```
LATIN              MEDIEVAL LATIN      MIDDLE ENGLISH  

Cura (care) --------> curatus -----------> curate
```
Select, organize, and look after the items in collections.

And `c` become `k` as this domain is avaiable.
