During my working hours, I perform a lot of research and wish to bookmark and share it with my network. The internal corporate chat does not operate because it is intended for internal use and provides no benefit to my former coworker. Using social media is a distraction during work hours. What I can do is take notes and share them later. This is time-consuming and forgettable.
